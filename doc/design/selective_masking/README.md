# Selective masking

Here are some detailed step-by-step examples of renderings with selective masking enabled.
Examples are taken from the tests and some intermediary images have been added to illustrate how the rendering works.

* [1 - Only labels mask other symbol layers](p1/README.md)
* [1b - Only labels mask other symbol layers (with symbol levels)](p1b/README.md)
* [2 - A symbol layer mask other symbol layers](p2/README.md)
* [3 - Merged masks](p3/README.md)
* [4 - Different masks on the same layer](p4/README.md)
* [5 - Different masks on the same layer (2)](p5/README.md)
* [6 - Label masks with effects](p6/README.md)
